# Objectives of the repository : Kepler's problem, Richardson's error, N-body problem, Regions of Absolute Stability, etc.  

This repository contains, at this moment, scripts for: 

 -> Solving Kepler's problem without using functions (HITO_1). <br>
 -> Solvin Kepler's problem using functions (HITO_2). <br>
 -> Computing global error with Richardson's extrapolation and convergence ratio of different temporal schemes (HITO 3).

 -> BONUS 1: Newton-Raphson's method for obtaining zeros of an escalar function (Newton.py)
